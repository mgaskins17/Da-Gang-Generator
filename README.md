## Description

This project includes the building of a team roster which will include the Manager, Engineers, and the Interns as well. This is a simple input execrcise of basic information which will then write to a HTML file and display the team roster. This project helped with OOP knowledge and using different files together to allow for a cleaner index js file while having functions used from different objects. We used the inquirer npm and jest npm to allow for user input prompts and quick tests to show functionality.

## Installation

First open the index.js file located in the root file and open the terminal for this file as well. First you will need to install the inquirer and jest package by typing 'npm i' in the terminal. Then you can either use the command 'npm start' to use the application built or the command 'npm test' to test the functionality using the tests I built located in the test folder.


## Tests

My tests are created and located in the test folder. You can use the 'npm test' function to run these tests which are designed to showing a passing value.

## Usage

The usage of this example is shown by a video which I left a link to in my subsmission.
